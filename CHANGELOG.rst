========

0.4.2 (unreleased)
------------------

- Core modules have been cythonized for additional performance improvements.


0.4.1 (2015-10-12)
------------------

- Now uses ``io.BytesIO`` for speed improvements in Python 2.
- Fixed a bug which allowed empty responses for non-void methods.
- Fixed a bug which caused the ``eq`` methods for structs, unions, and
  exceptions to raise ``AttributeError`` if the value being compared was of the
  wrong type.


0.4.0 (2015-10-09)
------------------

- Added an option to disable "required/optional" strictness on structs.
- Added ``to_primitive`` and ``from_primitive`` methods to generated types to
  allow converting struct, union, and exception values to and from primitive
  representations.
- Added a ``validate`` method to all ``TypeSpecs``.
- Changed to perform validation during struct, union, or exception construction
  instead of performing it during serialization.
- Allow unicode to be passed for ``binary`` types.
